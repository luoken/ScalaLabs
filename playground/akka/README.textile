h1. DUSE XII workshop

Akka Workshop project for the DUSE XII meetup.

The start folder contains a starting point sbt project for the workshop.
The finish folder contains a finished solution.

The sbt project is configured with idea and eclipse plugins, run sbt idea or sbt eclipse to generate an IDE project.

Don't forget to first run sbt update (in the start directory). After that you can build the gui and the kernel with sbt dist-gui, deployed to target/scala../dist/bin. 
The goal of the workshop is to implement the Actors in src/main/scala/duse12 based on the instructions in the Specs in src/test/scala/duse12, when everything is green, distribute the gui and kernel, run both gui and kernel and watch the show!
To make things simpler, you can also copy the src/test ot src/main from the finish folder, so that you only have to implement the Actors or the Specs.

Important notice: When running unittests akka complains that it misses the akka.conf file. This message can be ignored.
